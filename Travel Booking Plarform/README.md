# TravelGuru: A Travel Booking Platform

## Client Requirements
TravelGuru is a startup aiming to build an innovative travel booking platform. The platform will allow users to search for flights, hotels, and car rentals, as well as read reviews and ratings from other travelers. The key requirements are:
1. **Scalability:** The platform should handle a sudden surge in traffic without any downtime.
2. **Security:** User data, especially payment information, must be protected.
3. **Performance:** Users should experience minimal latency during searches and bookings.
4. **Cost-effectiveness:** The solution should be cost-efficient to suit the startup's limited budget.
5. **Global Reach:** The platform should be accessible to users worldwide with low latency.
6. **Data Analytics:** Insights into user behavior, popular destinations, and booking patterns are needed.

## Overview
This scenario outlines the architecture for TravelGuru, a scalable and secure travel booking platform. The solution leverages AWS services to meet requirements for scalability, performance, cost-effectiveness, and global reach.

## Architecture Components
- **Search Functionality:** Amazon CloudSearch with scheduled indexing using CloudWatch.
- **Database:** Amazon Aurora Serverless V2 for handling data with various resouce needs.
- **Back-end Logic:** Serverless Lambda functions for CRUD operations.
- **Global Reach:** CloudFront distribution in front of an S3-hosted front-end.
- **API Gateway:** REST API for secure and efficient front-end/back-end communication.
- **Data Analytics:** Amazon QuickSight for creating an admin dashboard to analyze user behavior and booking patterns.
- **Security:** Implementation of OAC for S3, appropriate IAM roles, and permission boundaries.

## Detailed Solution
1. **Search Functionality:** 
   - Use Amazon CloudSearch to index and search travel data.
   - Schedule indexing during low-traffic periods using CloudWatch.

2. **Database:** 
   - Utilize Amazon Aurora Serverless V2 for a scalable and cost-efficient relational database.

3. **Back-end Logic:** 
   - Implement CRUD operations using AWS Lambda functions to handle back-end processing.

4. **Global Reach:** 
   - Deploy the front-end on S3 and use CloudFront for global content delivery.

5. **API Gateway:** 
   - Choose REST API for caching and advanced features, ensuring high performance and security.

6. **Data Analytics:** 
   - Use Amazon QuickSight to create an admin dashboard for analyzing user behavior, popular destinations, and booking patterns.

7. **Security Measures:**
